Installing cuda 10.0 on ubuntu 18.04
---------------------------------------

Compatible software:
Installation Instructions:

1) Download run file and go by step-by-step on console
Do not select default driver there.
2) manually install the driver presented on the below:

Other installation options are available in the form of meta-packages. For example, to install all the library packages, replace "cuda" with the "cuda-libraries-10-0" meta package. For more information on all the available meta packages click here.
Patch 1 (Released May 10, 2019) 	
In this patch we introduce new APIs for JPEG stream parsing and device and pinned memory control as well as a new hybrid decode API that decouples decoding process into pure host and device stages enabling more flexible control flow. The new APIs also support ROI decoding and 4 channel jpeg bitstreams.


post installation steps:


nano ~/.bashrc

## Add following lines in ~/.bashrc at the end of file.

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64

export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2 ## To disable some warning for Tensorflow, which says to utilize EVX (i.e. specific components of CPU) for computation.

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ## To make CUDA visible. This can be done in PYTHON CODE too. Hence, it can be skipped for now.

source ~/.bashrc

# Install NVIDIA driver

# Issue with driver install requires creating /usr/lib/nvidia

sudo mkdir /usr/lib/nvidia

irst check compatible version of driver using following command:
$ ubuntu-drivers devices
Install automatically using following command based on abover recommended version:
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470


Please make sure that
 -   PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin
 -   LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script in /usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin

Please see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-10.0/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.

***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least 384.00 is required for CUDA 10.0 functionality to work.
To install the driver using this installer, run the following command, replacing <CudaInstaller> with the name of this run file:
    sudo <CudaInstaller>.run -silent -driver
